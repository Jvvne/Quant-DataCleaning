# Analyisis Using Pandas with Quantative Metrics
In this challenge, my goal was to compare portfolios of prominent companies-Berkshire Hathaway, Paulson, Soros, and Tiger- to to the S&P 500 and two algorithmic trading strategies. My comparison metrics were standard deviation (daily, annual, and rolling), correlation, beta, sharpe ratios, and exponentially weighted average. Then I plotted the cumulative returns of all portfolios to visualize the perfomances. Then, I used my analysis to give an opinion on how the algorithmic trading strategies compared to the portfolios and the S&P 500.
